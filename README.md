# Project Title  
This repository contains a PDF report for the project [profiling customer].  

## Overview  
This project aims to increase the number of customer bookings through more targeted telemarketing using the K-Means Clustering method. The main problem encountered was a decrease in the number of actual bookings by 2.61% from January to March 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year. In this project, customers were clustered based on characteristics such as income type, age, gender, number of family members, and region of residence.

Through the clustering results, three groups of customers were found with the main proportion in cluster 1 having dominant criteria, such as non-fix income type (71.30%) and age 18-45 years (80.61%). These results provide more targeted recommendations for telemarketing product offerings.
